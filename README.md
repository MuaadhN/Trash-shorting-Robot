# Trash Sorting Robot

The trash sorting robot uses a TensorFlow deep learning framework called SSD MobileNet V2 to identify and sort three types of trash, which are paper, metal, and plastic. The system uses a Raspberry Pi, Arduino UNO, CNC shield, Nema 17 stepper motorto obtain this capability. Conveyor belt system used to move the garbage.The robot is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with the capacity to sort trash quickly and correctly. The Trash Sorting Robot uses a progressive and sensible solution to the hassle of waste control. The deep learning-based computer vision algorithm is highly accurate and perceives the kind of trash with a high accuracy. The machine is also incredibly customizable, with the potential to feature new types of trash to the machine as wished.
